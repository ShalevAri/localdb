# LocalDB

## What Is This?

It's a local studio (Kind of like Drizzle Studio!) where you can interact with your local MySQL database.

## How Can I Use This?

Simply clone this repo onto your computer, and run either the `pnpm dev` or `pnpm serve` command from the `app` directory to start up your local studio.

From there, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see your new local MySQL studio!
